## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light gray (#f9fafb) in light mode and dark charcoal (#0f172a) in dark mode. The choice reflects a balance of calmness and modernity.
- Primary color: Blue (#3b82f6), used for primary actions. The hue suggests reliability and trustworthiness, both very important for financial products.
- Accent color: Green (#22c55e) for positive balance or income, and red (#ef4444) for expenses. Note that red will appear rarely, since most financial products try to encourage saving habits, rather than focusing on losses.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of text, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer lines of text in the body. This ensures a modern aesthetic with readability.
- Responsive grid layout to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
- Subtle transitions for UI elements and chart updates to enhance user experience.
- Use a set of clear and professional icons to visually represent transaction categories.
